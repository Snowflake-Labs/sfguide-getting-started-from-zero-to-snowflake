# Getting Started from Zero to Snowflake
## Overview
This guide explores Snowflake's core capabilities, starting with foundational features like Virtual Warehouses for scalable computation, UNDROP for seamless data recovery, and Resource Monitors for cost control. You'll learn to build automated data pipelines by ingesting external and semi-structured VARIANT data, then transforming it declaratively using Dynamic Tables. The quickstart introduces Snowflake's AI layer, leveraging Cortex functions for in-database intelligence and Copilot for SQL assistance. Governance is established through Snowflake Horizon, using role-based access control, column-level masking, and row-level policies to secure data, while the Trust Center enables security monitoring. Finally, the guide demonstrates how to enrich analyses by acquiring data from the Snowflake Marketplace and build interactive applications directly on your data using Streamlit.
